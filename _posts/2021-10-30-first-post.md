title: Honolua Bay, Maui
---

In the first post of this journal, I will be discussing one of the most beautiful waves in the world: Honolua Bay in Maui, Hawaii. A right-handed point break formed from a natural volcanic reef, Honolua is a fast and flowing spot with consistent surf and deep barrels. I have had the opportunity to surf this wave only one time, and I was instantly and incredibly humbled by the sheer power of the wave. Yet, the azure hue of the water and bacdrop of the gorgeous Maui coastline, Honolua Bay is one of the most special and unique palces in the world.
