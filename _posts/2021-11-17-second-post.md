## **What**
The purpose of Exercise 11 is to exapnd the students' knowledge of both Jekyll as well as CSS in the development of their GitHub Pages website. Students were required to alter the overall thematic elements of their page as well as create an interactive and styled navigation menu utilizing CSS. While I was completely successful in altering my theme and creating a navigation menu, I experienced certain issues in regards to the CSS styling of my navigation menu. This lab report is structured as follows:
* What
  * Challenges I Solved
  * Challenges I Did Not Solve
*  Why
   *  Observations
   *  Next Steps

### *Challenges I Solved*
In terms of challenges solved, the majority of my resolved issues focused on the implementation of themes into my GitHub Pages site. I first changed my theme to Architect; however, I did not like the editing options for the theme, so I switched back to the original primer theme. Next, I transitioned from the simplicity of the primer theme and changed my overall aesthetic to the Cayman Jekyll theme. 

### *Challenges I Did Not Solves*
The majority of challenges that I did not solve focused on the CSS alteration of my navigation bar. While I was able to implement the navigation page within my site, I had a difficult time in figuring out how to alter the style of each listing. Using both the in-class and outside resources, I utilized CSS to alter each listing to a "button" style; subsequently, I alered the padding, border, and hover aspects of each listing for further customization. However, despite my work, the final product still looks somewhat unappealing when compared to the remainder of the site. I would like to understand how I would be able to manipulate my navigation bar in CSS even further. 

## **Why**

### *Observations*
In terms of observations, the biggest thing that I noticed focuses on the potential complexity of CSS aesthetic development. As I was creating and altering my site, it was easy to see how I was just scratching the surface of CSS development with my own alterations. Additionally, I was given a deeper understanding and a higher level of respect for those websites that utilize CSS for more intensive site customization. 

### *Next Steps*

In terms of next steps, the most prominent is a continuation of the development of skills in GitHub, Jekyll, and CSS. Even after the completed exercises, Jekyll and CSS are still somewhat unknown to me, and I would like to continue honing and adding to my current knowledge of each program for potential future projects.
