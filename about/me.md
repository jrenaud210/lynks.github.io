## <div align="center">***About Me***

<div align="center">My name is Jack Renaud, and I am a senior English major at Texas A&M University. I am from Houston, Texas; however, my home has since changed to Jacksonville, Florida. I am currently in my last semester at A&M; following my graduation, I am moving to Florida to continue my studies in law school. After a brief career in environmental litigation, I plan to move to Uluwatu, Bali; I aim to open a surf shop and teach English at local schools. 
 
 ## <div align="center"> ***Interests***


<div align="center"> My most prominent and influential passion is surfing. I was formally introduced to surfing 5 years ago, and it has since become the cornerstone of everything that I love in life. While my home break is in Surfside, Texas, I have surfed in a variety of locations in the United States, including Maui and Lana'i, Hawaii. Additionally, I have had the beautiful opportunity to surf alongside some of nature's most beautiful ocean animals, including dolphins, stingrays, sea tortoises, and several different breeds of sharks. In the future, I hope to be able to surf in a multitude of locations across the globe as well as continue my passion for this beautiful sport throughout the rest of my life.
